ZFM SDK
=======

ZFM SDK is a Delphi written library for using various ZhianTec Fingerprint Modules (ZFM) under Windows and Linux operating systems. It was developed and tested for ZFM-20 and ZFM-60 models.

Integration
-----------

ZFM SDK can be used out of native Delphi applications created by Rad Studio and Lazarus as a regular Delphi unit. For other compiled languages like the C family ZFM SDK can also be used as shared library (see "lib" folder).

Samples
-------

There are three samples attached that should explain the usage of the project:
- The "sample" folder contains two equivalent non-graphical console applications for Lazarus and Visual Studio (C#) which use the shared library
- The "gui" folder contains a full featured graphical Lazarus application which uses the native Delphi unit
