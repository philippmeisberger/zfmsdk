===========================

There are three samples attached that should explain the usage of the project:
- The "library" folder contains two equivalent non-graphical console applications for Lazarus and Visual Studio (C#) which use the shared library (from "lib" directory)
- The "gui" folder contains a full featured graphical Lazarus application which uses the native Delphi unit
